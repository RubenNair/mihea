# README
This repository is a fork from [the GOMEA library](https://github.com/abouter/gomea), and contains the code for the algorithm from my [Master's thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/) based on  [this paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10762-2_34), called MIHEA.

## INSTALL
To install, execute the following in the root GOMEA folder.
```
make install
```

Then, to compile the executable, run `make cpp_MI_O`, which will generate the executable called `MixedIntegerGOMEA_O` in the `build` folder. 

## RUN
To run the code, run the executable. Adding the `-h` flag will display all available flags, their purpose and how they can be used.
